## ToDo:

- [x] Parsing completed
- [x] Basic language features
- [x] Type checking
- [x] Control flow (e.g. if while etc.) (Implemented via conditional functions])
- [x] Functions
- [ ] Included libraries (e.g. processes, io etc.)
- [ ] Speed up parsing
- [ ] Reflection (creating function handles from scratch)
- [ ] Compiling to byte code and running
### Maybe
- [ ] Compile to ELF
- [ ] Self-hosted
